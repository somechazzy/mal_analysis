# MAL Analysis
I felt like doing some analysing on MAL scores/favorites so I created a parsing tool for that purpose. 
So far I've only written code for calculating and sorting favorites-to-members ratio and posted it to r/anime, which you can **[find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/mji7f5)**.  

I might do more in the future if anything else piques my interest.
